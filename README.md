# Full-stack-web-based-application
A full stack online purchasing application has been built using PHP with atleast one trigger, one  procedural call and one view.

## Motivation :-
Long ago people used to go to offline stores stay in long queues and buy products or return them. This is unimaginably tedious process and energy consuming task just to buy any smallest of the smallest products. But due to invent of internet the process of converting any tedious process to time efficient and smarter ways are being created. And one of them is web based purchase model like Amazon. This project focuses on that smarter way which is my web based application using PHP.
